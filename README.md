# Rust Company Directory Exercise
My attempt at the [final exercise in chapter 8.3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch08-03-hash-maps.html) of the Rust book.

The exercise:
> Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in the company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales”. Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.
